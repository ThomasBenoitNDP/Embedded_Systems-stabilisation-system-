# Embedded_Systems-stabilisation-system

(French engineering project)
(Results presentation)

This document describes how I managed my French study final project (2017). In a team of two, we programed embedded boards to stabilize two “inversed pendulums”. 
The project involved two aspects:

-	A mathematical part: we should simulate the system on Matlab/Simulink so that we obtained the most optimal configuration values.

-	A programing part: we designed pieces of software to implement the mathematical model on embedded cards. This step was made in C and we used two ARCOM boards.
